# Spring Boot in the Cloud: Advanced Optimization Deep Dive

Spring Boot makes it easy to launch cloud-ready applications, but building truly lean and efficient cloud services requires going beyond the basics. In this three-hour deep dive, you’ll immerse yourself in advanced Spring Boot techniques to optimize your applications for the cloud.

We will examine in depth how to reduce memory usage, improve startup times, and streamline your Spring Boot apps for modern cloud environments. Topics include Spring AOT, classpath exclusions, lazy beans, actuator configuration, custom JVM options, and additional state-of-the-art tools.

This session combines short presentations, live coding, and practical hands-on exercises. You will experiment with advanced configurations, observe real-time results, and troubleshoot performance challenges alongside the instructor. Real-world scenarios and best practices will help you immediately apply these techniques to your own projects.

Whether you want to fine-tune your CI/CD pipeline or push Spring Boot to its limits in production, you will leave with actionable skills, a collection of code samples, and a deeper understanding of cloud-native application optimization. Get ready for an in-depth, practical exploration of building lean Spring Boot applications for the cloud.
